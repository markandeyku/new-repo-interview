 * 2. Vehicle Prototyping System
 * ðŸ’¡ Automobile companies often build concept car prototypes. Instead of building each version from scratch, engineers clone an existing model and modify it.
 *
 * Key Flow:
 * Base Model â†’ Clone â†’ Customize â†’ Final Car Design

/**
 * 3. Game Character Customization
 * ðŸ’¡ In multiplayer games like PUBG or Fortnite, players often start with a base character, which they can clone and modify (e.g., different armor, clothing, or abilities).

 * Base Warrior â†’ Clone â†’ Customize Weapons, Armor, Skills

Good one 👍 — “Why Kafka is fast?” is a classic interview question (especially when system design or
Kafka-based architectures come up). Let me break it down step by step in an interview-friendly way.

🔹 Why Kafka is Fast? (Core Reasons)

Sequential Disk Writes (Log-based Storage)

Kafka stores messages in append-only logs.

Writes are sequential → disk head doesn’t jump around (unlike random I/O).

Modern OS + SSDs + filesystem page cache make sequential disk I/O as fast as in-memory in many cases.

👉 Contrast: Traditional DBs often do random writes/updates, which are slower.

Zero-Copy Principle

Kafka uses sendfile() system call (Linux optimization).

Instead of copying data from disk → kernel → application → socket, Kafka lets the OS copy directly from disk → socket buffer.

This reduces CPU usage, memory copies, and context switches.

👉 Result: Extremely high throughput with minimal CPU overhead.

Partitioning + Parallelism

Topics are divided into partitions.

Producers write in parallel, and consumers read in parallel across partitions.

Scaling = add more partitions + consumers → more parallel throughput.

👉 Unlike queues (single bottleneck), Kafka parallelizes naturally.

Batching + Compression

Kafka batches multiple records into a single network request.

Reduces network round-trips.

Supports compression (snappy, lz4, zstd), reducing payload size.

👉 Higher throughput, lower latency, efficient bandwidth usage.

Memory-Mapped Files & OS Page Cache

Kafka relies heavily on OS page cache.

When producers write to Kafka, data goes into the page cache → flushed to disk asynchronously.

Consumers often read from this cache (hot data rarely touches disk).

👉 “Disk I/O” is actually “memory-speed I/O” most of the time.

Pull-based Consumption

Consumers pull data at their own pace (vs push).

Prevents overwhelming consumers (backpressure-friendly).

Allows for efficient sequential reads.

👉 Contrast: Push-based systems may cause congestion or throttling.

Simple Storage Model (Immutable Log)

Kafka doesn’t update/delete individual records.

Just appends to the log and, later, deletes entire segments.

No complex indexing overhead (like RDBMS).

👉 Simplifies storage + boosts performance.

Efficient Networking (TCP + NIO)

Kafka uses asynchronous I/O (NIO) and long-lived TCP connections.

Avoids overhead of repeated handshakes and connections.

Multiplexes many clients over a few sockets.

🔹 Summary for Interview

Kafka is fast because it relies on sequential disk writes, zero-copy transfer, partition-based parallelism,
 batching, and compression. It uses the OS page cache and immutable log structure to reduce overhead,
 and its pull-based consumption ensures consumers process data at their own speed. These optimizations
 make Kafka capable of handling millions of messages per second with low latency.

🔹 Follow-up Questions (Interviewers may ask)

How does Kafka achieve durability despite writing so fast?
👉 Answer: Replication across brokers, acknowledgment settings (acks=all), and log segment flushing.

What’s the role of Zookeeper/KRaft in Kafka performance?
👉 Metadata management, partition leader election, coordination.

How does Kafka differ from RabbitMQ / traditional MQs in performance?
👉 Kafka is log-based and optimized for throughput; RabbitMQ is queue-based and optimized for reliability & routing.
